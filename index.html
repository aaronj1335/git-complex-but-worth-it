 - some of you are going to start jobs (or are in jobs) where you'll use it every day
 - so obviously this is going to be relevant to you
 - some of you are going to use another version control system
 - some of you aren't even going to be programmers
   - project managers
   - product people
   - QA
 - it's important regardless
 - it's key to understanding how engineering teams work
 - your capacity to be effective hinges on your understanding of this process
 - it's funny because it actually matters more than your knowledge of sorting algorithms

              hard for humans just like computers

              <ul>
                <li class=fragment>multi-core processors</li>
                <li class=fragment>the mythical man-month</li>

          </ul>

          <aside class=notes>
 - quick anecdote
 - when multi-core processors became common and OS's rolled out support for them
 - the best case speed-up was 2x (for a dual core)
 - the worst case is 1x (none)
 - what they observed was actually worse performance
 - because of things like:
   - cache line bouncing
   - page table thrashing
   - lock contention overhead
 - similar phenomenon was observed in humans
   - in a book from 1975
   - adding more people doesn't always speed things up
 - one thing that's hard: context switching
   - it's easier to finish an assignment all at once
   - than to go back and forth
 - even harder: context merging
   - you're working with a partner on two separate parts of a project
   - headaches when it's time to integrate them together
 - so source control systems that just track changes aren't sufficient
 - so and just sharing those changes isn't sufficient
 - we needed tools that help us switch and merge contexts as well

          <ul>
            <li class=fragment>everyone has a copy of the entire history</li>
            <li class=fragment>change-set oriented</li>
            <li class=fragment>branching and merging are primary concerns</li>
            <li class=fragment>git, mercurial, bazaar, bitkeeper, darcs</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class=notes>
 - from a high level
 - these systems made context switching and merging a design goal from the start
 - several architectural differences:
   - everyone has the full repo
     - no longer a central point of contention
     - local operations are always faster
     - so it allows you to do more things locally
   - changeset oriented
     - instead of thinking about versions
     - everything is just incremental steps from here to there
     - this becomes important for quickly changing contexts
   - branching is a primary concern
     - by that i mean they are both fast and easy
     - they're also really flexible
       - can be local
       - or public if they're on a central, shared repo
         - but you can choose to ignore them

            <li class=fragment>
              it doesn't try to be too intelligent

            </li>
            <li class=fragment>many find it less intuitive</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class=notes>
 - faster than centralized vcs (svn, cvs) because local is faster
 - written in C by sharp systems programmers
 - it's less correct than bazaar about file renaming
 - it's less intelligent about change dependencies than darcs
 - most people prefer to trade the performance for these features

          <h3>the most important part: the social side</h3>

            <li class=fragment>it's good to be involved in a vibrant developer community</li>

              post your projects online

                <li class=fragment>don't wait until they're perfect!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <aside class=notes>
 - when we get a candidate for a developer position
 - the first thing i look at is not their resume
 - it's their code online
 - cause you can say anything on a resume
 - but reading your code tells me a lot
   - where you have expertise
   - how much you actually did on a project
   - if you're good at choosing tools
   - if you contribute back to projects with bugfixes
   - if you're polite
 - and once again, if you're not a programmer, this is a good way to find them

              merging is just moving the branch pointers together
